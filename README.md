# Nacl-Appstore
App store for non-casual gamers.[DEV]
I really dont like how mobile gaming state at the moment for gamers who really want to enjoy. Its an app getting created for gamers who are really intrested to help developers and vice versa.
## Development
1. Create an empty project.
2. Pakage name should be "com.nacl.android"
3. Copy paste app/src/main
4. Edit app/build.gradle for required libraries.

Open Diagram.odp for structure of class and fragments.
